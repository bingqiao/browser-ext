See article on [dev.to](https://dev.to/bingqiao/creating-a-browser-extension-for-safari-and-chrome-493m).  

Please refer to [Safari Web Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions) on how to create a Safari Web Extension  
project and how to install it locally on Mac. Please refer to [Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)  
for how different components work with each other and API docs for browser  
extensions in general.

This web extension allows you to auto refresh individual tabs in Safari/Chrome.  
The `start/stop` button controlls if an individual tab should be autorefreshing.  

The extension resources of this project come from [browser-ext-react-esbuild](https://github.com/bingqiao/browser-ext-react-esbuild)

Together the two projects serve as a template of creating browser extesnion  
for both Safari and Chrome (possibly Mozilla Firefox, but not tested) using  
React, TypeScript and esbuild.

The full AutoRefresh app (free and without Ads) implemented in a similar way  
can be found in App store [download](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/autorefresh/id1592466003) (free and no Ads).
